                            Great, you've gotten your folders and essential files set up,
                            now how do you actually test if your code is working and if your browser looks the way you want it to?
                        </p>
                        <label>-Unlike a regular .html file, you cannot use live server with VScode. Instead, follow along:</label>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>a.)</strong> Open up your project folder in the file explorer and type in "cmd" in your project folder to open up the command prompt once more:</p>

                        <br>
                        <label>-After a few seconds or possibly minutes (depending on your internet connection), you should see the following:</label>

                        <br>
                        <label>-If your build was successful, your command prompt should tell you so like above.</label>
                        <br>
                        <label>-If your build was unsuccesful, copy paste the error message into google and hope for the best.</label>

                        <p> After you have your project up and running there are a few tips, tricks and things to remember!</p>
                        <p>
                            When running on your local machine before publishing, or anytime you will want to make changes to your project before
                            republishing, you must run the ember server command above.
                        </p>
                        <label>When programming you will run into issues & have to correct errors.</label>
                        <label>A great tool to use when debugging is the Ember Test Server!</label>
                        <label>-Follow the steps below to create a test server for your new project:</label>
                        <p><strong>a.)</strong> Open a new command prompt and type the following:</p>
                        <h3 id="h3-color">cd "projectName"</h3>
                        <p>-This will get you into the proper directory.</p>
                        <label>To start the test server type:</label>
                        <img src="images/ember-test-server-1.png" alt="test1" id="ember-test-server">
                        <p>When the test server builds and begins running, a new browser page will be opened that shows all the running or failing tests.</p>
                        <p>As you can see, I purposly showed an example with failing tests to show you what messages you will recieve.</p>
                        <h3 id="h3-color">ember t -s</h3>
                        <img src="images/ember-test-server-2.png" alt="test2" id="ember-test-server">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <label>-Below is the browser window that will open.</label>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/ember-test-server-3.png" alt="test3" id="ember-test-server">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <label>You can now write code and test it all in real time!</label>

                    <div class="stepContainer">
                        <div class="information-content"></div>
                        <h2>Step Six</h2>
                        <p>To begin, we start with an index page. We create a new file in the templates folder. This is the first page on your site and will be the jumping off point for all your other pages.</p>
                        <p>We add an image and a button here the site is very attractive and easy to use.</p>
                        <br />
                        <img src="images/indexPage.png" alt="index" id="indexPage">
                        <br />
                        <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
                        <p>You'll want a navigation bar to be able to scroll between the pages of the application!</p>
                        <p>We create a the navigation bar in Components becuase we will want to be able to use this on all the template pages.</p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>- All of these links use @route which is how the program passes arguments and the word encapsulated in quotation marks is the actual route link. This is essentally the same as a hyperlink.</p>
                        <br />
                        <img src="images/Nav-Bar.png" alt="nav" id="nav">
                        <br />
                        <h2>Search Page</h2>
                        <p>Youll create a search page in the templates folder. This will be the page where the user can search for properties.</p>
                        <p>The @rental passes an argument to the models js that holds all the attributes that each property will hold. This will be called once and we will be able to use it for all the rental properties.</p>
                        <img src="Images/search.png" alt="search" id="search" />
                        <h2>Map API</h2>
                        <p>One of the coolest parts of this application is the map API that we implemented. Initially we wanted to use Google Maps and have it be able to track the properties based on cities automatically.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Unforunatly, Google likes to charged for such features so we were forced to look else where. We found Mapbox API was free and has been used in many ember applications, so after watching a few tutorials
                            we were able to implement it.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>The only ussue with the free version is the user needs to insert all the lat and lng points maunally to find the locations on the map.</p>
                        <img src="Images/filter.png" alt="filter" id="filter" />
                        <h2>Filter</h2>

                        <p>Another interesting feature with this application is the use of a search bar which allows the user to type in a city and the program will automatically perform a search query and look through all the objects in the JSON database to see which city matches the query.</p>

                        <h2>Host A Stay Page</h2>
                        <p> The Host A Stay page used Vanilla JS to implement dynamically generating a new rental to the search page </p>

                        <label>first, make sure to create input tags specific to ember's syntax in a .hbs file named "host".</label>
                        <br />
                        <img src="images/host1.png" id="cmd-pics" />
                        <br />
                        <label>-Now, Create a javascript script tag and initialize an array to store your new object </label> <br />
                        <img src="images/host2.png" alt="test1" id="ember-test-server" /> <br />
                        <label>Also, set the form submit button to the button click function</label> <br />
                        <p><strong>a.)</strong> Now, we will create a function class to have a constructor to hold the values of the inputs</p>
                        <p>We will also initialize the values from the user-inputed values, and create a new object with those values</p>
                        <img src="images/host3.png" id="cmd-pics" />
                        <p>We then add the objects from the Array initialized earlier, and store it into localStorage so the data may persist to the search page</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <h2>Search Page Vanilla JS</h2>
                        <p> Now that we have a new rental object created and stored into local storage, we will now access it with a button and display it dynamically onto the bottom! </p>

                        <label>First, we will create another array in the Javascript script tag and assign the onclick function to the button as well</label>
                        <br />
                        <label>In addition, we will create a function to look inside the localStorage, and push each item from localStorage to the array</label>
                        <br />
                        <p>finally, we dynamically generate elements to display the new rental object calling the "populate" function for each index visited in the searchPageArray</p>
                        <img src="images/search1.png" id="cmd-pics" />
                        <br />
                        <label>The populate function will create all these elements for later appending to the main rental Div tag </label> <br />
                        <img src="images/search2.png" alt="test1" id="cmd-pics" /> <br />
                        <p>at the end of the populate function, we append like so:</p>
                        <img src="images/search3.png" alt="test1" id="cmd-pics" /> <br />
                        <p>Now, once the "Click me" button on the search page is clicked, it will display the newly added properties</p>
                        <br>
